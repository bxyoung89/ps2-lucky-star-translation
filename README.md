# ps2-lucky-star-translation
translation project for らき☆すた ～陵桜学園 桜藤祭～ 

# Disclaimer
This is my first translation project so I know nothing about ps2 development. I also know very little japanese. However, I've always wanted to do a translation patch, so that's what I'm going to do.

# General Plan
1. Find out what files contain text in the game
2. Figure out if it is possible to replace text in the game
3. Replace Text in the game
4. Find out how to patch ISOs

# Why this game?
Visual novels seem like they'd be a bit easier to work with since the code should be simpler than, lets say an action game. It should be just menus. Also I like lucky star.
