# PS2 File types
There are a bunch of different file types. Wanted to compile my notes about them here.

## ADX
Audio files. You can play them in vlc but they have a bunch of static and will hurt your ears.

## ACX
Is an archive. Contains ADX files.

## AFS
Is an archive. I use [afs packer](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/843/) to extract the files.

## BIN
??? I think this is an elf file.

## DIR
Table of contents for a folder. Stored in plain text.

## IMG
Disc Image???

## ISO
The disc image for the final game. This is what emulators can run.

## IRX
IRX is definitely code. When I throw it into ps2dis I get valid things. Also using [madedit-mod](https://sourceforge.net/projects/madedit-mod/) to look for characters

## OBJ
supposedly a 3d model format but doesn't work with any programs I try. 95% sure it's images in this case

## SFD
Low res movies! Can open with VLC
